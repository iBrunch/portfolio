[Live Demo](https://lets-chat-sa.herokuapp.com/)

## Explanation

LetsChat is a messaging app where users can create topics and chat about them.

## Problem

People love to talk about their shared interests but forums can be too slow and clunky, and message apps can be annoying with constant notifications.

## Solution

LetsChat combines the organization and persistence of a forum with the speed and spontaneity of a live chat.

## Results

The end result is a clean, simple conversation that users can hop into and out of at any time.

## Conclusion

LetsChat was fun to build and has potential features Iâ€™d like to explore, like voice chat, gif support and reactions.
