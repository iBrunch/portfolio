Hi! I'm Scott and I'm a full stack web developer with 3 years of experience in Javascript and one year of experience with Ruby on Rails. 

I switched career paths two years ago and have self-taught myself HTML, CSS, Javascript and Ruby. I'm always improving on my core language and in the two years, I’ve gone from zero to building projects like [Tip Together](https://tip-together.herokuapp.com/) and [TomaTempo](https://tomatempo-ibrunch.herokuapp.com/). I’m eager to continue to learn and hone my skills. I’m excited to take what I’ve learned and bring it to a team. I want to get my hands dirty building and improving a product and push myself to be a key contributor to an awesome team.
